A complete, desktop-based Library Management System application built with Java Swing. This project provides a user-friendly graphical interface for managing books, borrowers, and loans within a library environment. It features separate views for Librarians and Borrowers, each with role-specific functionalities.

All application data, including books, users, and their complete loan histories, is persisted locally using XML files, which are managed by the JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding) framework.
